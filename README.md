## How to add a DNS record

To request a DNS record to be added, make a pull request to this readme, adding to the table below.

The request will be merged as soon as the record is added. (sometimes it take a little while to propagate)

If you want to check to make sure the correct IP Address(es) were added, run the following:

```bash
dig [subdomain].cubigdata.com +short
```
